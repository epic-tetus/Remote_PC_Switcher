# Remote_PC_Switcher
__Remote PC switcher using ESP32__

## Principal Concept

1. We can turn computer on by using Power SW pin in the Motherboard.
2. In usual case, there is a physical switch between Power SW + pin and - pin.
3. I think i can control flows between + pin and -pin using microcontroller and also cotrol remotely.
4. Connect ESP32 to motherboard, Control ESP32 with Mobile Application through socket server.    __Parfait!!!__
